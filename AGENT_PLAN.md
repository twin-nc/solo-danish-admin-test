# Agent Plan — Danish Tax Administration Platform

## Current State

The project has a fully working **Python/FastAPI backend** for the Registration module:

- PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy 2.0 + Alembic migrations
- Layered architecture (Router → Service → Repository → Model)
- Domain events via an abstract EventBus (InMemoryEventBus, swappable to RabbitMQ/Kafka)
- 14 passing integration tests with full transaction isolation
- 5 API endpoints: health, register party, get party, assign role, list roles

**What does not exist yet:**
- Frontend (no UI at all)
- Authentication / authorisation
- Tax Filing module
- Tax Assessment module

---

## Agent Roles

### Architect Agent
Designs all system components that do not yet exist, producing a single spec file that all Coder agents use as their source of truth.

**Responsibilities:**
- Define the frontend architecture (Next.js + TypeScript)
- Design JWT-based authentication (login, refresh, roles: admin, officer, taxpayer)
- Design the Tax Filing module following existing patterns (services / repositories / routers / events)
- Design the Tax Assessment module (same pattern)
- Define all new API contracts and request/response schemas
- Define new domain events and event handlers
- Document how all modules communicate through the event bus

**Output:** `AGENT_ARCHITECT_SPEC.md`

---

### Designer Agent
Defines the visual design, component library, and user flows for the admin platform UI.

**Responsibilities:**
- Design the admin dashboard layout (overview stats, recent registrations, filing status)
- Design Registration, Filing, and Assessment pages
- Define the component library (tables, forms, cards, modals, status badges, navigation)
- Define design tokens (Danish government-inspired palette: navy blues, whites, greys, accent colours)
- Map user flows for each role (admin, officer, taxpayer)
- Define responsive layout breakpoints

**Output:** `AGENT_DESIGN_SPEC.md`

---

### Frontend Coder Agent
Implements the Next.js frontend using the Designer's spec and Architect's API contracts.

**Responsibilities:**
- Scaffold the Next.js + TypeScript project under `frontend/`
- Implement authentication pages (login, logout, token refresh)
- Implement the admin dashboard
- Implement Registration views (register party, view party, assign role)
- Implement Filing views (submit filing, view filings)
- Implement Assessment views (view assessments, status tracking)
- Connect all views to the backend API using typed API clients

**Input:** `AGENT_ARCHITECT_SPEC.md`, `AGENT_DESIGN_SPEC.md`
**Output:** `frontend/` directory

---

### Backend Coder Agent
Implements new backend modules following the existing architecture patterns.

**Responsibilities:**
- Implement the Tax Filing module (`app/routers/filings.py`, `app/services/filing.py`, `app/repositories/filing.py`, `app/models/filing.py`)
- Implement the Tax Assessment module (same structure)
- Implement JWT authentication middleware and user model
- Add Alembic migrations for all new tables
- Wire new modules into `app/main.py`
- Publish and handle domain events between modules

**Input:** `AGENT_ARCHITECT_SPEC.md`
**Output:** New modules inside `app/`, new Alembic migration files

---

## Phase 3 Agents (Later)

### Test Agent
Writes automated tests for all new code following the existing testing patterns.

**Responsibilities:**
- Write API integration tests for Filing and Assessment endpoints
- Write tests for authentication (login, token validation, role enforcement)
- Write tests for new event handlers
- Ensure test isolation using the existing savepoint transaction strategy

**Input:** All new code from Coder agents
**Output:** `tests/test_filings.py`, `tests/test_assessments.py`, `tests/test_auth.py`

---

### Docs Agent
Generates and updates all project documentation.

**Responsibilities:**
- Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` to reflect new modules and authentication
- Generate `API_DOCS.md` covering all endpoints with request/response examples
- Write a `SETUP.md` covering local development, environment variables, and running the full stack
- Document the event flow between all modules

**Input:** All code, `AGENT_ARCHITECT_SPEC.md`
**Output:** Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md`, new `API_DOCS.md`, new `SETUP.md`

## Execution Phases

### Phase 1 — Parallel
Run Architect and Designer agents simultaneously. They work on independent outputs and do not depend on each other.

```
Phase 1:
  Architect Agent  ──→  AGENT_ARCHITECT_SPEC.md
  Designer Agent   ──→  AGENT_DESIGN_SPEC.md
```

### Phase 2 — After Phase 1
Run Frontend Coder and Backend Coder agents in parallel. Both consume Phase 1 outputs.

```
Phase 2:
  Frontend Coder Agent  ──→  frontend/
  Backend Coder Agent   ──→  app/ (new modules)
```

### Phase 3 — After Phase 2
Run Test and Docs agents in parallel once all code exists.

```
Phase 3:
  Test Agent  ──→  tests/ (new test files)
  Docs Agent  ──→  ARCHITECTURE.md, API_DOCS.md, SETUP.md
```

## Handoff Flow

```
Architect Agent ──┐
                  ├──→ Frontend Coder Agent ──→ Test Agent ──→ Docs Agent
Designer Agent  ──┘
                  └──→ Backend Coder Agent  ──→ Test Agent ──→ Docs Agent
```

## Technology Decisions

| Concern | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend framework | Next.js + TypeScript | App Router, SSR, type safety |
| Auth strategy | JWT (access + refresh tokens) | Stateless, works well with FastAPI |
| Auth storage | HttpOnly cookies | Secure, not accessible to JS |
| Component styling | Tailwind CSS | Utility-first, consistent with design tokens |
| API communication | fetch with typed response models | No extra dependency, matches Pydantic schemas |
| Future event bus | RabbitMQ or Kafka | Already abstracted via EventBus ABC |
| New backend modules | Same patterns as Registration | Consistency, no relearning curve |

## Notes

- All agents must follow the existing naming conventions and code style.
- No agent modifies another agent's output files directly.
- The orchestrator (Claude Code) coordinates handoffs between phases.
- Agents in the same phase run in parallel and work on non-overlapping files.
- The event bus remains the only cross-module communication mechanism — modules never call each other's services directly.
